# Moods

Quite frequently, new people I meet on the Internet (and especially those on
IRC) tell me that I seem to be angry at them, or in a bad mood. They're
normally wrong.

## My Explanation

I have been using IRC for about a decade. As of writing, my IRC client tells me
I am on:

* 13 IRC Networks
* 262 IRC Channels
* 2 IRC Queries/Private Chats

Including scripts and other non-chat items, that is 283 currently open buffers
("tabs"). That is pretty normal for me.

"Time is money." I only sit in channels I care to read, or, in rare cases,
those that might have interesting links posted that will show up in my IRC link
aggregator for later viewing.

My point is: my attention on IRC is divided about 300 ways at all times, and
I'm almost always working on other things at the same time. So chatting becomes
more mechanical than social &mdash; people send me questions or requests and I
make sure they are given a timely, definitive answer. Otherwise, I will end up
doing nothing but chatting all the time.

**A side effect of this attitude is that some people get cold, short answers.**

If you often ask me for help with things, you will get this from me a lot. I
enjoy helping you or I wouldn't be doing it.

## Solution

Change your expectations. I'm not:

* Angry at you
* Annoyed by your questions
* Disappointed you are dumb

If I am any of those things, I won't hesitate to tell you.

## Things That Do Anger Me

* You don't read READMEs.
* You don't actually read things to which I provide links.
* You disregard the advice of myself and others.
* You ask questions but then reject answers because you think you know better.

If you do any of the above things, expect to be
ignored/banned/k-lined/ridiculed, unless you are paying me money.
