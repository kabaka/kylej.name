# Home

My name is Kyle Johnson. I design and implement solutions to problems at scale. These days, I have little time to write code: as a manager, I focus on enabling those on my team to continually learn, grow, and ultimately succeed.

On this site, you may find links to things I've written (code and otherwise), my photography, and how to get in touch.
