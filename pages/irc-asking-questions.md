# Asking Questions on IRC

If you want to annoy people on IRC, do this:

    <newbie> hi, can I ask a question?

Don't get permission to ask your question. **Just ask it.**

## But why?

IRC is full of idlers. You've probably noticed that you sometimes join a
channel with 100 people in it, but nobody at all is speaking. *This is normal.*

When you show up with a question, if you ask everyone if you can ask your
question, there are a few problems:

1. The few people that happen to notice channel activity will have to go out
  of their way to answer your initial "can I ask?" question. Unless you're just
  in the wrong place, the answer is going to be "yes."
2. If they answer that question, they've now committed themselves to answer a
  second question: the _actual_ thing you want to ask. Some people are simply
  too lazy for more than one.
3. Someone with the answer to your real question may not check the channel for
  new activity after they see your uninteresting request for permission.

## The Solution

Even if it is the first thing you've ever said on the whole IRC network, just
start with your question. Nobody will think it is rude. Nobody will thank you
for cutting to the chase, either, but at least you won't hear any complaints
(unless you're in the wrong place).

Asking before asking:

* Wastes time
* Someone has to answer another question that doesn't get you any closer to
  solving your problem
* Makes it obvious you have no idea what you're doing

Starting with the real question:

* Less typing for you
* Less typing for everyone else
* No sarcastic "don't ask to ask, just ask" replies
* Faster resolution for you
* Higher chance of getting an answer at all
