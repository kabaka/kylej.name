# Sleep Disorder

I have what is called
"[non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-24-hour_sleep-wake_disorder "Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder on Wikipedia")."

Basically, this means that my body's internal clock operates on a non-24-hour
day. The exact day length is somewhere between 25.8 and 26.1 hours.

## How it Works

I get tired and go to bed two hours later every day, and wake up two hours
later the next day.

_(My actual wake-up time seems to shift less readily than my sleep time &mdash;
I assume this is because our wake time is partially set by when we eat our
first meal of the day, and that makes the previous day's wake time "stick" a
little. If I eat a late breakfast, my wake time does seem to move forward with
my sleep time.)_

In an attempt to determine exactly what is going on, I have recorded my sleep
and wake times with [Sleep Bot](http://mysleepbot.com/ "SleepBot Home Page")'s
[Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lslk.sleepbot "SleepBot Tracker on Google Play").

From that, I have a graph of the last year or so of my sleep. The shaded area
of the graph is time asleep, and the unshaded area is time awake. Left to right
are the days, top to bottom are the hours in each day. Times are UTC.

## Practical Limitations

You can see that my rotation stopped near the end. I got a job that required I
be awake at the same time every day of the week. Normally, I just work for
myself (I'm an independent contractor, and I have a shared hosting DBA that
brings in a few dollars), but tough times called for drastic measures.

This job's long hours and no days off had a bad effect on the amount of restful
sleep I got. Here is a graph of the hours of sleep I got per night from the
first day I worked until a few days ago. The blue line is amount of sleep at
which I feel rested all day.

Prior to this, I was averaging around 8.5 hours of sleep per night.

Every day, my body would not be ready for sleep until two hours later. As I had
to wake up at the same time each day, that meant I got two hours less sleep,
until I simply couldn't rotate forward any further. At that point, I would just
get a few hours of sleep every night once I was exhausted enough to sleep
regardless of the time.

The spikes on the graph are from when I was so tired that I immediately went to
bed after my shift. In the last few days, you can see that I set up a kind of
hellish oscillation wherein I slept 12 hours one day and then 2 the next.
Despite my best efforts, that seems to be continuing.

## Benefits & Workarounds

It's not all bad. I get to experience each part of the day. This has a few
benefits:

* I get to talk to people around the world with equal frequency.
* I am able to perform staff duties on IRC networks at any time of the day.
* I am awake longer hours at a time than most people, so I seem to get more
done in one day.

I have had this problem since I was in middle school. I managed to work around
it back then, but it was not easy:

* Middle school: tired every day, barely slept.
* High school, grades 9 through 11: slept through some classes.
* High school, grade 12: half day at school, concurrent enrollment at community
  college with on-line classes. Slept after school, did college work whenever.
* First job: slept the whole time I was not at work. No, really.
* University: too tired to function. Slept through many classes despite four
  alarm clocks and lots of caffeine.
* Life until now: work for myself, sleep when I want, feel better than ever
  before.

I have tried sleep aids, but those are not useful long-term and had no lasting
effect on my sleep pattern. Wake-up aids (such as caffeine or some fruits) are
insufficient. Bright lights or sunlight don't change anything. I have given up
trying to treat this.
