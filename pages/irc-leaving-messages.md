# Leaving Messages on IRC

This is something that comes up enough that it does get kind of annoying.

Here is how you should leave me (and, presumably, anyone that knows how to use
IRC) messages when I'm not around in various circumstances:

## Connected

Highlight me (say my name) followed by your message, preferably on the same
line.

    <user> Kabaka: I just installed Linux!

Rationale:

* Most clients have key combinations that navigate through recent highlights in
  the chat area. The less reading required, the better.
* Some clients (including mine) list highlights in a special area. If you
  include your message in the highlight, I don't even have to press any keys to
  read it.
* It is quite easy to configure IRC clients to forward highlights to mobile
  phones. It's much more useful to have a complete message show up than just
  someone saying your name.
* Highlights generally cause some type of audible notification. If I have to
  wiggle my mouse to read your message, I want to be able to quickly determine
  if it is worth my time or not.
* Bots' *!mail* commands and other such message delivery facilities are
  absolutely pointless when my client is connected, as I will already have read
  the messages when I review my highlights, and will not need them to be
  spammed to everyone again.

## Disconnected

My personal preferences, in order of most desirable to least desirable:

1. Send me an email.
2. Send me a MemoServ message.
3. Wait for me to get back.
4. If and only if MemoServ isn't available and you don't trust anyone, leave it
  with a "mail" bot.

Rationale:

* Email is made for exactly this use case.
* MemoServ is made for exactly this use case when you don't know my email
  address. I always configure MemoServ to forward to email if that feature is
  available.
* Bots with "mail" commands tend to have one of these problems:
  * Messages are delivered in public, either disclosing private messages or
    annoying users.
  * The bot is far more likely to be off-line than MemoServ is.
  * There is no implied guarantee of privacy with bots.
